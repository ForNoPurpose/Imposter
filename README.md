<h3>
About : 
</h3>

- Completely original 2D game using Unity, C#, and Aseprite for artwork
- Created by [Orion Hogan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/orion-hogan/) and [Chris Britton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-britton/)
- All scripting, art, animations, and game mechanics are built from scratch
- Currently being designed with flexibility in mind (multiple input device options)
- Since Imposter is a work in progress we will be updating current game functionality here
